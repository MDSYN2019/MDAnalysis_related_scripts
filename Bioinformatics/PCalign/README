############################## README for PCalign ##############################
This is the README file for the program PCalign. PCalign identifies a structural
alignment between two interfaces of a given pair of protein dimers, and gives a 
PC-score that quantifies the extent to which the local physical and chemical en-
vironment between the two interfaces match.

Before running the program PCalign, the input PDB files need to be pre-processed 
by PCprepare. For large-scale calculations on a set of PDB files, all PDB files 
can be pre-processed once and for all. An input PDB file needs to contain 2 sep-
arate chains.

To pre-process an input PDB file, say input.pdb, run the following:

PCprepare input.pdb

PCprepare generates 4 auxiliary files, input_contacting.pdb, input_contact.map, 
input_contacting_labeled.points and input.hash, all of which are required for
interface comparison. Together with the original file, input.pdb, these 5 files
need to be put in the same directory where PCalign runs.

After all PDB files of interest are pre-processed, a given pair of protein dime-
rs, say input1.pdb and input2.pdb, can be compared using:

PCalign input1.pdb input2.pdb

If the user wishes to compare the geometric properties of interfaces only, the
following can be run:

PCalign input1.pdb input2.pdb -chem off

Other than the standard output PCalign prints, it also creates an additional fi-
le, transformed_input2.pdb.for.input1.pdb, which is the second input PDB file a-
ligned with the first input PDB file.
